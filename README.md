## Introduction
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for drug discovery with molecular graphs. Nevertheless, current GNNs mainly excel in leveraging short-range interactions (SRI) but struggle to capture long-range interactions (LRI), both of which are crucial for determining molecular properties. 

To tackle this issue, we propose a method to abstract the collective information of atomic groups into a few ***Neural Atoms*** by implicitly projecting the atoms of a molecular. Specifically, we explicitly exchange the information among neural atoms and project them back to the atomsâ€™ representations as an enhancement. 

With this mechanism, neural atoms establish the communication channels among distant nodes, effectively reducing the interaction scope of arbitrary node pairs into a single hop.

## Installation (2D scenario)
We have tested our code on `Python 3.8` with `PyTorch 1.12.1`, `PyG 2.2.0` and `CUDA 11.3`. Please follow the following steps to create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
conda env create -f 3D_Molecule/env.common.yml

conda install pytorch=1.12.1 torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install pandas scikit-learn
conda install openbabel fsspec rdkit -c conda-forge
pip install dgl-cu111 dglgo -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/repo.html

pip install performer-pytorch
pip install torchmetrics==0.7.2
pip install ogb
conda activate neural_atom
```

## Reprodution
We provide commands for 2D and 3D scenario to reproduce the paper as follows.
